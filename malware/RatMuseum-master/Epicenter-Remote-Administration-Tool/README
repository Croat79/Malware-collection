I've started working on Epicenter merely to kill some time. However,
after some point, it has become one of the most enjoyable projects that
I've worked on.

Epicenter is a complete remote administration tool which
supports transferring files and folders, editing registry entries, watching
and controlling the remote display, turning off and rebooting the remote station,
locking and unlocking any form of user input (keyboard etc.) and many more.

In order for the client to work behind firewalls, Epicenter establishes a
reverse connection and is fully undetected by anti-virus software.
The client doesn't have to be compiled for every target computer since it
uses the end-of-file data to initialize some of it's customizable variables
such as the reverse connection interval and IP.

I am putting it on GitHub so that people who are interested in concepts
like reverse connection or file transfer can look at the code for reference.
However, since this was a personal project, it may lack some useful commenting.
